== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why didn't my scheduled campaign send on time? =

WordPress uses WP-Cron, which only runs when someone visits your site. If your site has low traffic, scheduled campaigns may be delayed.

**Automatic Recovery:**
The plugin automatically detects and sends overdue campaigns when you visit the Campaigns page. You'll see a success notice confirming the send.

**For Production Sites (Recommended):**
Set up a real cron job to ensure campaigns send exactly on time:
1. Add to `wp-config.php`: `define('DISABLE_WP_CRON', true);`
2. Set up a system cron job (via cPanel or server) to run every minute:
   `* * * * * wget -q -O - https://yourdomain.com/wp-cron.php?doing_wp_cron >/dev/null 2>&1`

= What if a campaign fails to send? =

Failed campaigns will show:
- A red error notice at the top of the Campaigns page
- The exact error message in the "Error" column
- A "Retry Send" button to try again

Common errors include missing Reply-To email (now fixed automatically) or invalid Sendy API credentials.

= Campaign stuck at "Preparing to send..." in Sendy? =

This means Sendy's cron job isn't running. Sendy needs its own cron to process campaigns.

**Quick Fix (Manual Trigger):**
Visit: `https://your-sendy-domain.com/scheduled.php?i=1`

**Permanent Fix (Set Up Sendy Cron):**
Add this cron job to your server (via cPanel or SSH):
`*/5 * * * * php /path/to/sendy/scheduled.php > /dev/null 2>&1`

This runs every 5 minutes to automatically process queued campaigns.
