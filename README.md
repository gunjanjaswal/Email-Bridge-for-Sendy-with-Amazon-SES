## ✨ Features

### 🎨 Visual Newsletter Builder
*   **Hero + Grid Layout:** Automatically formats your first selected post as a featured "Hero" card, and subsequent posts as a neat **2-column grid** (on desktop).
*   **Live Preview:** See exactly what your email will look like as you add posts.

### 📱 Mobile-First Responsive Design
*   **Smart Stacking:** Grid items automatically switch to a **single-column layout** on mobile devices (< 600px).
*   **Auto-Height:** Cards adjust their height dynamically to fit content, removing awkward whitespace on small screens.
*   **Readable Typography:** Optimized font sizes and spacing for mobile reading.

### 🖼️ Professional Media Handling
*   **Integrated Banners:** Banner images are fully integrated into the Hero card with rounded corners.
*   **No-Crop Scaling:** Banners use `height: auto` to ensure 100% of your image content is visible (no heads or text cut off).
*   **High-Res Thumbnails:** Uses the 'Large' image size to prevent blurriness on retina screens.

### 🛠️ Powerful Admin Tools
*   **Instant Search:** AJAX search bar to find any post in your database.
*   **Campaign Management:** 
    *   **Status Columns:** View `Draft`, `Sent`, or `Scheduled` status directly in the campaign list.
    *   **Scheduling:** Set a date/time for your campaign, and WP-Cron will trigger the send automatically.
    *   **Status Indicators:** Color-coded statuses (Green for Sent, Orange for Scheduled).
